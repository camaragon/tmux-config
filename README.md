# Tmux Configuration

This repository contains my personal tmux configuration and plugins. It aims to provide an improved terminal experience with enhanced navigation and functionality.

## Installation

First, clone this repository to your `.config` directory or whever you want to install tmux:

```bash
cd ~/.config
git clone https://github.com/camaragon/tmux-config.git
```

## Installing Plugins

With TPM, plugins are defined in the .tmux.conf file. Once you have the desired plugins listed there, you can install them by starting a tmux session and pressing `Prefix + I` (capital i, as in Install).

## Uninstalling Plugins

To uninstall plugins, remove the plugin name from the .tmux.conf file, save the changes, and press `Prefix + alt + u` in a tmux session.

## Updating Plugins

To update all installed plugins, press `Prefix + U` (capital u, as in Update).

## Key Bindings

This configuration defines several custom key bindings to enhance tmux's usability. Please refer to the .tmux.conf file for details.
